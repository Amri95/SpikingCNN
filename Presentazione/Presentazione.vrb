\frametitle{Introduction}

Spiking Neural Networks communicate through \textit{spikes}, that are discrete events that occur at certain points in time.\\
\bigskip
When a neuron reaches a certain potential value, it spikes, so it resets its value.\\
\bigskip
This modelling allows us to handle spatio-temporal data,
that are real-world sensory data.
